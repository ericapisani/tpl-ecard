# TPL eCard

A way to have your Toronto Public Library card handy when you accidentally leave at home!

Enter the number and have the barcode generated on your phone.

The number is stored locally on your device - it is never sent to any server.

## Notices/Disclaimers

1. This is not an official Toronto Public Library application. This was made as a personal project for learning purposes.

2. This code comes with no warranty. Use at your own risk.

## Thank-yous

While in general a huge thanks goes out to the open source projects that this project is built on, I want to give a special shout out to the person who made the ['Better Barcode Generator' Expo snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@wodin/better-barcode-generator). Their code provided the basis for the barcode generation and spared me many hours of frustration :)

## Notes

React is pinned to 18.2 due to a peer dependency that requires this version specifically (React Native). When this changes both packages will be updated
